# README Generator ![alt text](https://img.shields.io/badge/LICENSE-MIT%20License-blue)
  
  ## Description
  A program that generates a README file based on user input from prompts is something I see myself using repeatedly. It is such a useful project that has taught me a lot while building it. It makes creating a professional README so much faster. I feel much more confident in using callback functions now, as well as understand reading and writing files with the File System (fs) module.

  ## Installation

  ## Usage
  With node installed, run "node index.js" in your command prompt. This will start the README Generator app. Answer each question as they are prompted and hit the enter key. At the end, your responses will be displayed, and your README.md file will be inside of the 'Generated_README' folder.
